# finalproject

Please write your initial proposal for your final project in this README document. What type of project is it? 

- Package?
    - data package
    - analysis package
- Shiny app? 
- Something else?

Where do you expect to find data? Do you need help finding data? What question will your project answer or purpose will it solve?

Proposal:

We're going to create an intuitive research tool for people looking to relocate in the United States. This will be a user-friendly shiny application which will consider a variety of factors--such as location, climate, housing prices, crime data, and population density--so that our users can find a living situation that most closely aligns with their preferences.

Most (if not all) of our data can be found from data.gov.
